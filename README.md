### Adaptable 

- **Learned Ruby in a day** before applying to a code boot camp with skill requirements to enter the course( **10% acceptance rate** )
- During a challenge to use no frameworks for a single paged website, **created a Testing framework from scratch** to successfully **test drive** a project in a language I had learned three days prior (**Javascript**).
- **Built my own mini websites and projects** in my free time to gain better understanding of **API integrations**, resulting in my teams success in integrating our backend API and 3 other APIs into our front end.

### Team Player

While completely competent with autonomous work, I am a **proven team player with extensive experience**. My time in the military has taught me well on how to **integrate into any team** at any level. My time at Makers had taught me how to **grow collabrativly** with my team. Being **Adaptable, Disciplined, and Highly Motivated** I can easily be attached to any team.
